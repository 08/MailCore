RELEASE NOTES
--------------

Version 0.2.6
--------------
- Updated to LibEtPan 0.49
- Built an entirely new MIME parsing component. Eventually I will expose this so others can build up or parse complex MIME structures if necessary.
- Improved fetching of body text for messages, there are still a few edge cases that aren't taken care of, but it's much better, see README.txt for more information.
- SMTP has been reworked internally, and now it is possible to enable/disable authentication.
- A slew of unit tests have been written. If you have tests that you have written, please send them my way!
- A few random convenient methods, like isEqual: for CTCoreAddress, have been added,
- Memory leaks fixes
- @executable_path/../Frameworks/ IS once again the default for the installation location. This makes it a snap to put into your apps framework folder.

Version 0.2.4
--------------
- Message flags now work


Version 0.2.3
--------------
